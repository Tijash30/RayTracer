/*This is one of the most important classes, many classes have this one as a father class, because of its atributes, all of them are needed in
* many other classes, so in here thay are declered and they all have their getters and setters. Object3D also is an abstract class.
* And lastly, it implements the interface IIntersectable, so all of its children classes also implements it. We can see that with this attrivutes
* you can get and set all the information that an object has, thats whay the inportance of this little methods (getters and setters)
* so you can get or set its values simply.   */

/*class intersection is going to be a class on which several (or almost all) other classes are going to be
based. It will have different attributes such as distance, normal, position and object each with its
hetters and setters. That's all this class has, it's only important to stress that this class will
support different methods that are overridden in different classes that implement the IIntersectable interface.
all this attributes gives an object of type Intersection all the information of a ray intersecting
with something or no.*/
